# Mixed Presence in Mixed Reality

This repository hosts the survey data and website from the survey paper "Mixed Presence in Mixed Reality: Charting the Challenges and Opportunities" authored by Katja Krug, Wolfgang Büschel, Marc Satkowski, Stefan Gumhold, and Raimund Dachselt. 

## Reconstruction instructions: 

### To develop and deploy the website

1. `npm install` installs all the libraries you need to get the app running using the list from `package.json`.
2. `npm run build` updates and exports `index.html`, and the files in `dist/assets` for a static website. 
3. `npm run dev` the site locally (localhost) in development mode (updates to src files reload the site).
4. To deploy to Github Pages, push the `index.html` on `/dist` (created by `npm run build`) onto the `gh-pages` branch. The folder is in `.gitignore` so that `git checkout` does not affect it. 

### To create data files (python script) 

1. The [`Survey-Info.csv`](/src/data/Survey-Info.csv) file contains the core corpus described in the paper. 
   2. The taxonomy columns accept lists of strings (comma separated), or marks ("x") for values that apply. 
   3. `Name`, `Year`, `Authors` (comma separated), `DOI`, `Bibtex`, and `source` (default "handpicked") are required. 
2. Create the config and data json files: 
   1. [create-jsons.py](/src/data/create-jsons.py) describes the survey categories using the `includeProp`, `categories`, and `groups` dictionaries. 
   2. Running the script generates [survey-data.json](src/data/survey-data.json) and [survey-config.json](src/data/survey-config.json). 
   WARNING: The script deletes the existing files, if entries have been [manually added](#to-manually-add-papers), they will be lost. 
        ```bash
        python create-jsons.py -n "Mixed Presence in Mixed Reality" -d "Charting the Challenges and Opportunities" -a "Katja Krug and Wolfgang Büschel and Marc Satkowski and Stefan Gumhold and Raimund Dachselt" -g "https://github.com/imldresden/mp-survey""
        ```
   3. The script prints out warnings for empty fields from the `includeProp` dictionary. You may use this to enforce value combinations (e.g. "at least one column from group A and one from group B"), or to identify edge cases. 
3. Note that the "topView" entry of `survey-config.json` must be updated to include orcids and further details about citation (see existing versions in the repository).  
4. Build the website as explained in [Running the Webpage](#running-the-webpage) to see the created entries. 

### To manually add papers 

After the paper's cut off date, papers should be added by editing the [src/data/survey-data.json](src/data/survey-data.json), under the `"data"` tag. You can use this template: 
```json
"data": [  // array of paper objects
    {
        "Name"   : "[Poster] Visualization of solar radiation data in augmented reality",
        "Year"   : "2014",
        "Bibtex" : "'@INPROCEEDINGS{6948437,\n  author={Beatriz Carmo, Maria and Cl\u00e1udio, ....",
        "DOI"    : "10.1109/ISMAR.2014.6948437",
        "Authors": [
            "M. Beatriz Carmo; A. P. Cl\u00e1udio; A. Ferreira; A. P. Afonso; ...."
        ],
        "source": "handpicked",
    },
]
```
We welcome such updates via pull requests (which can be generated using the website itself, too)!

## Ackwnowledgements: 
The website is produced using [this survey tool](https://github.com/imldresden/survey-tool). It is a fork of the [Indy Survey Tool](https://github.com/VisDunneRight/Indy-Survey-Tool) from [Khoury Vis Lab](https://github.com/VisDunneRight) that differs in style and responsive behavior, which is why it's hosted separately. Big props to them for their initiative!
